# Seas & rivers should stay at 0.0 severity bias
# Unused provs are provs not set in the game yet, so 0.0
# Unused provs based on data in mapdata\default.map
# Some provinces use override modifiers, which makes them use the override values instead of default WINTER_EFFECTS_FACTOR_XXX as set in 00_defines.txt
# These are:
# mild_winter_factor_override
# normal_winter_factor_override
# harsh_winter_factor_override
