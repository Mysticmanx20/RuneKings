Before her stands [outsider.GetFullName], a dwarven poet, his quill poised above a worn parchment. The gathered barbarians pause their boasts to watch, sensing something momentous.  “Dororan,” Gudrun declares, her voice ringing like a warhorn, “your poems weave tales of love that echo beyond the mountains. I want our story to be more than words. Marry me, and let’s carve a legend across Gielinor!”  Dororan fumbles his quill, his eyes wide. “Gudrun, your spirit outshines the stars, but I’m a dwarf of ink and dreams. Can a poet stand beside a warrior’s daughter in this wild land?”  The crowd’s tension grows, wary of a union that might cause strife in the tribe. As the leader of these lands, what is your counsel?"
