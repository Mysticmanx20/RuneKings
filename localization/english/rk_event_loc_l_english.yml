[local_character.GetSheHe|U] mentions that they are searching for 'Zanaris' - a magical hidden city of great treasures.\n\n[local_character.GetFullName] recounts how [local_character.GetSheHe] found a leprechaun that supposedly knew how to reach Zanaris. The leprechaun revealed that by taking a dramenwood staff through a secluded shed out in [GetTitleByKey( 'c_lumswamp' ).GetName], one will then be transported to Zanaris.\n\nPerhaps I should change course to discover this lost city myself?"
