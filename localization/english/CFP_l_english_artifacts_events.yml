The word has spread of our glorious conquest. To rightfully praise such a momentous occasion, we need something unlike anything else, something that will stand the test of time. I’ll return soon, once the details are worked out, and your legitimacy as a ruler will never be challenged." \n\nAs I attempt to grasp what great work he has planned, I’m humbled in knowing this is a person I assuredly can trust."
 cfp_title_event.0001.a.odo:0 "May the Lord bless you in these pursuits, [bishop.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
 cfp_title_event.0001.bishop:0 "[bishop.GetFullNameNoTooltipRegnal] approaches me. \n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], you stand as our rightful ruler! The word has spread and such a remarkable feat should be praised. We need something unlike anything else, which will last for many generations to come. I’ll return to you soon, once the details are worked out." \n\nAs I attempt to grasp what great work he has planned, I feel obligated to grant him my lenience. After all, the Pope supported my claim over England."

It has been named the Telle du Conquest.""
 cfp_title_event.0002.a:0 "Such a magnificent tapestry!"

 cfp_artifact.0001.desc:0 "A man wearing only a colorful loincloth appears before me. \n\n"My name is [traveler.GetFullNameNoTooltip], I hail from a very distant country. I was accosted by bandits just outside your beautiful castle, and I’m scared to sleep outside. Would you be so kind as to host me tonight?""
 cfp_artifact.0001.a:0 "Guards! Remove this beggar from my sight!"
 cfp_artifact.0001.b:0 "Of course, you’ll spend the night in my dungeon."

 cfp_artifact.0002.t:0 "The Traveler has Vanished"
 cfp_artifact.0002.desc:0 "You arrive at the stables early in the morning. It seems [traveler.GetFullNameNoTooltip] disappeared without much of a trace. You only spot some flattened hay and a small cloth wrapping."
 cfp_artifact.0002.a:0 "What's this?"
 
 cfp_artifact.0003.desc:0 "You arrive at the stables early in the morning. It seems [traveler.GetFullNameNoTooltip] disappeared without much of a trace.

You may have encountered my beautiful sculptures on the calvaries next to the roads of your domain.\n\nI thought you might want to become my benefactor. Indeed, as my name has become quite famous among your subjects, both of us could benefit from this partnership. \n\nAs proof of my good faith, I would create a unique and masterful sculpture for you to display wherever you wish, showing your immense piety to the world.""
 cfp_artifact.0005.a:0 "I've never heard of you, and you don't #italic look#! very talented."
 cfp_artifact.0005.b:0 "It sounds like a great opportunity."
 
 cfp_artifact.0006.t:0 "Local Sculptor Ripped Me Off"
 cfp_artifact.0006.desc:0 "A guard brings me a rock on which a message is attached. \n\n"To the stupid [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], \n\nYour charity has no equal on this earth. When you receive this note, I will be far away, telling the world how gullible you are." \n\nThe message is signed by the hand of [sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip]. There is not much you can do now."

 cfp_artifact.0007.desc:0 "[sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip] comes back with the product of his labor. You inspect the statue from head to toe. \n\nThe folds of Mary's dress fall nicely and soberly. She holds Jesus in her arms and looks happy, full of grace. As your eyes fall on Jesus' face, you can't help but retch. His eye cavities are empty, his face and nose are simple lines. This is a terrible work and an insult to his holiness."
 cfp_artifact.0007.a:0 "I should have known, leave and never come back."
 cfp_artifact.0007.b:0 "How about you sculpt your nails in my dungeon?"

 cfp_artifact.0008.desc:0 "[sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip] comes back with the product of his labor. You inspect the statue from head to toe. \n\nThis is obviously a Saint, or maybe a bishop, but you don't dare to ask whom. The sculpt is sharp with beautiful curves and lines. It will surely impress your court, and the local sculptor will peddle your name alongside his humble but honest art."
 cfp_artifact.0008.a:0 "Nice! Tell them you have my benefice, [sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip]."
 
 cfp_artifact.0009.t:0 "Local Sculptor is Gifted"
 cfp_artifact.0009.desc:0 "[sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip] comes back with the product of his labor. You inspect the statue from head to toe. \n\nThis is Virgin Mary. Her hands are joined in prayer and her eyes closed. The sculpting is sharp, with a complex veil covering Mary's head and falling over her shoulders. This is how everyone should see her when listening to the liturgy."
 cfp_artifact.0009.a:0 "I want you at my court so you can promote my name!"
